# Introduction to CyberSecurity
Different Cipher method have been implemented to Encrypt and Decrypt the text

I have learned and understood few cipher when I was undergoing through cybersecurity course and want to share my experience in implementation of various cipher. I hope you guys would like it and feel free for any suggestion towards improvement of any code.

## Atbash Cipher
Atbash  is a simple substitution cipher originally for the Hebrew alphabet, but possible with any known alphabet.
It is considered 'complex'. But, it has a possible key, and it is a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher. However, this may not have been an issue at the time when the cipher was first devised.
